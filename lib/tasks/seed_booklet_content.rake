    text: "The organising committee welcomes you to the biology14 conference !

The “biology” conference is the annual joint congress of the Swiss Zoological Society (SZS), the Swiss Botanical Society (SBS), and the Swiss Systematics Society (SSS). After 2006, the conference is back in Geneva and is hosted by the Sciences campus of the University of Geneva.

The conference provides the opportunity for young scientists from Swiss universities and research institutions to present their work in organismic biology.

It is also open to students and scientists from universities of surrounding countries and to non-professional connoisseurs. There will be talks by invited keynote speakers as well as talks and posters presentation by young Swiss researchers.

One important goal of the meeting is to demonstrate the enthusiasm of researchers in Switzerland, and neighboring countries for research activities in fields as diverse as evolutionary biology, systematics, biodiversity, ecology, evo-devo, and many more…

The rich diversity of topics and questions that are tackled in this conference is made possible thanks to the many young scientists who submitted a contribution. The abstracts we received were of outstanding scientific quality, making the selection of oral presentations highly competitive and the poster communications of high standards.  We warmly acknowledge everyone.

We would like to thank our keynote invited speakers, Jonathan Leake, Alexandre Antonelli, Diethard Tautz, Bastiaan Ibelings and our Darwin Dinner speaker, Pierre-Henri Gouyon, for their willingness to be part of this conference and to inspire us with their great achievements and brilliant talks.

We sincerely hope you will enjoy the conference and your time here.
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact one of us!

Jonathan R. Leake is full Professor at the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of Sheffield, UK. He is an expert in mycorrhizal fungi and plant-soil interactions. His current research lines include:
1.  the evolution of plant-fungal symbioses
2.  effects of mycorrhizal fungal networks of power and influence at all scales (from nano to global scales in contemporary ecosystems and over the past 450 million years)
3.  the adapationds and functioning of myco-heterotrophs: plants parasitic on fungi (including most orchids)
4.  root adaptations as an alternative strategy to mycorrhiza
5.  pollution impacts on plants, soil biology and chemistry, and health."

Alexandre Antonelli is associate Professor at the Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Sweden. He is an evolutionary biologist with practical and theoretical experience ranging from fieldwork in the tropics to molecular-based laboratory and analytical techniques. His research interests focus on the origins and evolution of tropical America’s outstanding biodiversity and he is becoming increasingly interested in evaluating how past responses to climate changes may improve the predictions of species losses under Global warming, and how this knowledge can be used for conservation."

    Diethard Tautz is full Professor and Director of the Department of Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Germany. The research lines of his group include the identification and characterization of genes involved in adaptation processes using the house mouse (Mus musculus) as a model system. They apply a broad range of genomic techniques, but also behavioral, morphological and mapping approaches. The characterization of the identified genes includes experiments in semi-natural environments."

Bastiaan Ibelings is full Professor in Microbial Ecology at the Institute F.-A. Forel, Section of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Geneva. He’s current research interest and projects are organized into four research lines:
1.  evolutionary origin of biodiversity, with projects about adaptive radiation and niche construction in Pseudomonas and co-evolution of resource competitors;
2.  diversity at the population level, with investigations on the role of fungal parasites in the maintenance of intraspecifc diatom diversity;
3.  diversity at the community level, centered on lake phytoplankton community assembly;
4.  loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, with a focus on toxic cyanobacteria, their massive proliferation and the negative consequences on ecosystem services."

Pierre-Henri Gouyon is full Professor in Evolution, Genetics, Ecology and Ethics (among other) at the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, at AgroParisTech and Sciences Politiques, Paris. His current research interest and projects include theoretical considerations about the mechanisms underlying and driving the main functions of living organisms (sex, mutation, dispersion, death, …), considering the forces that act at different levels of integration (genes, individuals, metapopulations, species), in order to decipher the role of chance, selection and historical contingency in evolutionary processes. His theoretical works are greatly complemented by experimental biology on plants."
