      <ol>
        <li>
          evolutionary origin of biodiversity, with projects about adaptive radiation and niche construction in Pseudomonas and co-evolution of resource competitors;
        </li>
        <li>
          diversity at the population level, with investigations on the role of fungal parasites in the maintenance of intraspecifc diatom diversity;
        </li>
        <li>
          diversity at the community level, centered on lake phytoplankton community assembly;
        </li>
        <li>
          loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, with a focus on toxic cyanobacteria, their massive proliferation and the negative consequences on ecosystem services.

      </p>
      <p>
        His current research interest and projects include theoretical considerations about the mechanisms underlying and driving the main functions of living organisms (sex, mutation, dispersion, death, …), considering the forces that act at different levels of integration (genes, individuals, metapopulations, species), in order to decipher the role of chance, selection and historical contingency in evolutionary processes. His theoretical works are greatly complemented by experimental biology on plants.

      <p>
        The research lines of his group include the identification and characterization of genes involved in adaptation processes using the house mouse (Mus musculus) as a model system. They apply a broad range of genomic techniques, but also behavioral, morphological and mapping approaches. The characterization of the identified genes includes experiments in semi-natural environments.

      <p>
        He is an evolutionary biologist with practical and theoretical experience ranging from fieldwork in the tropics to molecular-based laboratory and analytical techniques. His research interests focus on the origins and evolution of tropical America’s outstanding biodiversity and he is becoming increasingly interested in evaluating how past responses to climate changes may improve the predictions of species losses under Global warming, and how this knowledge can be used for conservation.
